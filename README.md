What is Aws GuarDuty?
Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior to protect your AWS accounts and workloads.


How Amazon GuardDuty Uses Its Data Sources?
•	AWS CloudTrail event logs
•	VPC Flow Logs
•	DNS logs
If you are using a 3rd party DNS resolver, for example, OpenDNS or GoogleDNS, or if you set up your own DNS resolvers, then GuardDuty cannot access and process data from this data source.
